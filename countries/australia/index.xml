In fact, yesterday marked the day that my visa expired and would have had to leave the country. If I was still using that same visa that is. Which I&amp;rsquo;m not.
Yes, I have a so-called 457 or Temporary Business Entry (Class UC) Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457) visa now for Australia. Regardless of the strange bureaucratic behaviour of using a crazy name and then only focusing on the number, this means that I (and Kelsey as she was the secondary applicant on it) can stay here for 4 years as long as there is a company sponsoring me.</description></item><item><title>Back on the road in Tasmania</title><link>https://www.arjen.eu/2013/04/back-on-the-road-in-tasmania/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 12:22:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.arjen.eu/2013/04/back-on-the-road-in-tasmania/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this blog, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to jump forward to the present time. I&amp;rsquo;ll post about all the earlier happenings as well, but for now I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to know what I&amp;rsquo;m up to at the moment. So, without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s a short post about Tasmania.

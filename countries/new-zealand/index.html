As I already had my car and they are located about 20 km from each other it was easy to visit both before I made up my mind about which one I was actually going to visit.

Anyway, the Catlins are best travelled by car as that gives you the time to stop where you want and just take your time admiring the scenery without being on a specific schedule.</article><div class=read-more-link><a href=https://www.arjen.eu/2012/06/driving-through-the-catlins/><span class=read-more-slashes>//</span>Read More...</a></div></section><section class=post><header class=post-header><div class=post-avatar-wrapper><a href=/countries/new-zealand><img class=post-avatar alt="New Zealand" title="New Zealand" src=/img/flags/new-zealand.png></a></div><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.arjen.eu/2012/03/the-tranzalpine-experience/>The TranzAlpine experience</a></h1></header><p class=post-meta><span class=post-date><span class=post-date-day><sup>24</sup></span><span class=post-date-separator>/</span><span class=post-date-month>Mar</span> <span class=post-date-year>2012</span></span>

About a year ago, Wouter, a (now former) colleague and friend of mine went to live in New Zealand with his girlfriend and we opened the presentation for the last project he was a part of with this image, all in good fun of course.

With only about 42 days left until my flight leaves from Amsterdam so that I might be introduced to what is supposed to be a country nearly as beautiful as the Netherlands. Okay, admittedly New Zealand has some nice features that aren&rsquo;t here, but on the other side it doesn&rsquo;t have Amsterdam.
Seriously though, I&rsquo;m looking forward to going there and seeing with my own eyes the beauty of the country that so far I&rsquo;ve only heard of or seen on the TV.</article><div class=read-more-link><a href=https://www.arjen.eu/2011/09/42-days-and-counting/><span class=read-more-slashes>//</span>Read More...</a></div></section></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-5024731-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');</script><div class=footer><hr class=thin><div class="pure-menu pure-menu-horizontal pure-menu-open"><ul class=footer-menu></ul></div><p><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/><img alt="Creative Commons License" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png></a><br>All original writing on this site is licensed under a <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div></div></div></body></html>

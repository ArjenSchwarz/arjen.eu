      <description>This site contains a log of my travels. So, who am I?
 Yes, this is me   My name is Arjen, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Dutch guy currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I ended up here after travelling around for a bit and decided to stick around. Before that I traveled through New Zealand for almost a year, as well a couple of other places before coming to Australia.</description>

      <description>Ok, you might ask. Why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt in so many photos? Is it some kind of fashion statement?
Actually, no. It’s the result of a request from my friends. During the weekend in Germany I was told that I should take a picture wearing this Hawaiian shirt every single day. Of course, I figured a request (read: demand) like that isn’t too hard so I agreed to do this.</description>

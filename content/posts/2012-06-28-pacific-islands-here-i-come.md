This Saturday, June 30, I'll take a plane to the Cook Islands, where I'll spent almost two weeks enjoying the sun, after which I'll take a flight out to Fiji.

Everything I've read about these lovely places indicates that it will be very expensive to make phone calls or use the internet on the islands there, so I have no intention of doing either. Instead, I'll just enjoy the sun, the beaches, the ocean, and generally the whole not doing anything except enjoying myself.

So, if you don't hear from me for that period that's the reason why. Saying that, I do hereby present my flight plans for those of you interested in that. These are the flights to the islands, and my subsequent flight to Australia, all dates and times are local, which might look strange due to dateline crossings.

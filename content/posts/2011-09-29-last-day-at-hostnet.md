Tomorrow is the last day I will be working at [Hostnet][1], the company where I've spent so much of my time for the past 6 years. It's been a lot of fun to work there and I've met a lot of good friends during the years. Friends I'll miss during my travels, but luckily it's a lot easier to stay in touch these days over vast distances than it used to be.

In the years I've spent at Hostnet I have seen it grow in many ways, becoming a major player in the Dutch hosting scene, and have grown a lot myself as well. Starting as a programmer I finally ended up managing the department, and had a lot of fun doing so. Yes, there are many things I can say about that time, but I'm not going to do so here. Maybe in another post, but not right now.

Because there is something else on my mind now. In many ways, tomorrow is a turning point in my life. No longer will I have the security of a regular income and the comfort of knowing what I will be doing the coming weeks. After tomorrow I will no longer have a job, and considering I just paid my for my last month of rent, I will lose my place to live a month later. Not that I'll still be in the Netherlands by when that happens. As I write this I notice that the counter shows there's just a bit more than 25 and a half day left before I'll be boarding my plane on my way to adventure.

Yes, tomorrow is a real turning point as this realization of what's going to makes me feel nervous about my plans to be travelling. Nervous, but also a lot more excited because it is a challenge to go out in the unknown and discover what's going to happen there.

So, to all my former colleagues, both those of you who are still there on Monday as well as those who left before me, I just want to say thank you for the wonderful time I could work with you. But for now I've got a new challenge, and I'm looking forward to enjoy it. Don't worry though, while you'll be suffering through this coming winter I'll be sure to keep you up to date with the summer I'll be enjoying. But first, tomorrow evening it's time to say goodbye in the only way that truly counts: with a party.

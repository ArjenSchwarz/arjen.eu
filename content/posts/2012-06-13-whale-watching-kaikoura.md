One of those things you're supposed to do when visiting New Zealand is to go whale watching. Of course, you don't have to, but it is an interesting experience nonetheless and the best place to do it is Kaikoura. So, that was my next stop after [Abel Tasman][1]. I didn't go alone either, as Laura decided to come along before she was going to visit the North Island. Jeroen decided to go there immediately, so it was just the two of us. I'd gone here before with Kelsey, but at that time the weather was bad enough that no tours were going, this time I was more lucky.

There isn't actually much to say about this, as whale watching in this case consisted of getting in an airplane and viewing these big animals from the sea, going low enough that we had a good view.

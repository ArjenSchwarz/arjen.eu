This site contains a log of my travels. So, who am I?

{{% figure src="/img/profilepicsmall.jpg" title="Yes, this is me" class="float-right" %}}

My name is Arjen, and I'm a Dutch guy currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I ended up here after travelling around for a bit and decided to stick around. Before that I traveled through New Zealand for almost a year, as well a couple of other places before coming to Australia. And of course, from Australia I can easily visit more countries so I'm doing that as well.

This blog therefore serves both as a way for me to remember where I've been and look back on that, as well as a place where friends and family can easily see what I've been up to.

As you can see by the dates at one point I pretty much stopped updating, but I'm planning on catching up on that.

If you're more interested in what I do professionally, you can find that on my other site [ig.nore.me](http://ig.nore.me)
